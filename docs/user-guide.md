To use the web app, start by interacting with the file card to upload or select a file of your choice—such as an image, document, or any media type supported by the app. Once the file is ready, proceed to the form below to input relevant details like "Title," "Description," or even random preferences like "Color Theme" or "Priority Level." If applicable, use the lightswitch control to toggle features on or off, for example, enabling a “Public View” option. Finally, navigate through the carousel to review all uploaded files or images by clicking the left or right arrows. This allows you to verify or enjoy multiple entries at a glance.
